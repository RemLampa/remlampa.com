I've never had the chance to blog regularly as promised. So I've decided
to just move my blog from Wordpress (hosted on SiteGround) to Gatsby.js
(hosted on Github pages). My blog frequency couldn't justify the high costs
of web hosts.

I'll try to blog more often, especially about the experiences I'm about to
have while our team and I build our startup, FarmGoat, from the ground up.

Stay tuned.
