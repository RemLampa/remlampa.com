Enough\nto live by, but never going to get them anywhere near achieving financial freedom.</p>\n<p>Alumni of UP, Ateneo, La Salle… Engineers, teachers, accountants, doctors… Some\nhave graduate degrees even!</p>\n<p>One of the DJs joked that his co-host earns four times their monthly salaries, hosting\nwedding receptions for 2 hours! Four times an engineer’s salary making people play\nmusical chairs!</p>\n<p>We were led to believe that going to school was the only way to have a successful\nlife.
