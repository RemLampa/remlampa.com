I will also refer to it as simply <code class=\"language-text\">package</code>.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">project</code> - Any code that reuses a <code class=\"language-text\">package</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For this tutorial, we will not do anything wild. The package will just be printing a simple message on the console.</p>\n<h3>Setting Up</h3>\n<p>Create two folders, one for the package and another for a sample project that will install and demo the package, and run <code class=\"language-text\">npm init</code> on both of them. Name the package and project folders as <code class=\"language-text\">private-package</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">package-demo</code>, respectively. Optionally, you may also run <code class=\"language-text\">git init</code> to create repositories for each folder.</p>\n<p>Go to the package directory and create a folder named <code class=\"language-text\">src</code>, and inside it create a file named <code class=\"language-text\">index.js</code>.</p>\n<p>Go to the project directory and create a file named <code class=\"language-text\">index.js</code> at the root.</p>\n<h3>Dive into the Code</h3>\n<p>Add the following into <code class=\"language-text\">private-package/src/index.js</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">printFromPackage</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    console<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'Hello from package'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\nmodule<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>exports <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> printFromPackage<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Creating a Local Private NPM Package","date":"February 19, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/creating-local-private-npm-package/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/starting-over/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Starting Over"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/fostering-an-inclusive-philippine-startup-community/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fostering an Inclusive Philippine Startup Community"}}}}
